# FaceGesture Identity Access

## Overview
"FaceGesture Identity Access" is an innovative project that integrates facial recognition and hand gestures to provide secure identity verification and efficient access to personalized information. It uses two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models to identify faces and classify hand gestures from images captured in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time facial recognition
- Hand gesture identification
- Secure identity verification
- Efficient access to personalized information

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swamisharan1/face_recognition.git
```

## Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application
```bash
streamlit run vis_model.py
```

## Usage
After running the application, youâ€™ll be prompted to allow access to your camera. The application will then capture images in real-time and use the trained CNN models to identify faces and classify hand gestures.
